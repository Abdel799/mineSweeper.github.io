Welcome to my mine sweeper project in python! If you're unfamilar with the rules of mine sweeper here's a quick explanation:

1. Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares.
2. Safe squares have numbers telling you how many mines touch the square.
3. You can use the number clues to solve the game by opening all of the safe squares.
4. If you click on a mine you lose the game!

Enjoy!
